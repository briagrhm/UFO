### By typing whichever criteria you want to see specifically and pressing enter a filtered list will show up with that information.

## Summary 

One of the drawbacks of the website is that the data is limited. This is not a complete list. This website could be further developed by allowing for user input of sighting as well as maybe images of the sightings. This could help with visually seeing what could be considered unusual as well as help skeptics that dont believe the listed sightings.
